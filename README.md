# Binder with DESCRIPTION file

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/karthik/binder-description/master?urlpath=rstudio)


This version contains:
- runtime.txt
- A fake DESCRIPTION file with 2 dependencies

Works fine, downside is that I want Tidyverse without the long slow install. How can I have rocker/binder-3.5.1 as my base image + packages?
